<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> it has been taken for granted, because
no abhorrence of the recent proceedings of
the New Academy has been openly expressed,
such feeling is non-existent, this opuscule
has been written in the confident belief that
it expresses the opinions of a majority of
civilized Whist-players.</p>

<h2>THE DECLINE AND FALL OF<br />
WHIST.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IF we only live long enough we all pass
through at least three stages—one authority
says seven;—we grow, we attain our prime,
we decay; and Whist, apparently, is not exempt
from the common lot.</p>

<p>Somewhat obscure in its origin, it gradually
developed, it arrived at its zenith, then began to
go down hill, and became the piteous spectacle
we now see, until, flying from the whist-room as
from a pest-house, the players are betaking
themselves in shoals to other and unholy games.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>There is an opinion that Whist is at the
present moment so exceedingly popular that it
is fast becoming a serious rival to afternoon tea,
and this, so far from being inconsistent with my
original statement, rather strengthens it; for it is
quite possible that a certain percentage of the
more reputable refugees from the clubs, averse
to gambling, may have sought—and I hope I
may add, found—consolation in the family
bosom and the domestic rubber.</p>

<p>The golden age of Whist lasted from the time
when Cavendish arranged in a systematic form
his selections from the wisdom of our ancestors,
until the death of Mr. Clay, twelve years ago;
then the age of wood began, and if the whole
subsequent literature of Whist had been publicly
burnt by the common hangman, including <i>nostri
farrago libelli</i>, it would have been an unmixed
boon; so greatly has the evil preponderated
over the good.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>




<h2>WOODEN ARRANGEMENT, NO. 1.—THE PETER.</h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> peter, simple in its inception, and ineffably
stupid in execution, was already on the scene,
and though among decent players it soon found
its level, and became comparatively inoffensive,
was the pioneer of the mass of wood-paving
which has since been laid down; echoes, tampering
with the discard, penultimates, antepenultimates,
developments, extensions of principle,
rules for exceptional play, with a few other
matters <i>quod nunc perscribere longum est</i>, all
equally inelastic, but differing from the signal in
this, that while its mission is to supply your partner
with brains and to dictate to him, regardless
of the state of his hand, to play trumps
when you think fit, theirs is to do away with all
necessity for any brains whatever.</p>

<p>The call for trumps appeared in this form,
and in this form Bumblepuppydom believes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
it to this day. “Whenever a player is strong in
trumps, whether he has any reason for wanting
them out or not, he informs the table of the
fact, and it is imperative upon his partner to take
the most violent and extraordinary steps to
get in and lead him one.” However, the proceeding—when
not useless—turned out so injurious
to the perpetrator, that it had to be
mitigated (for in that benighted day it had not
been discovered that it was philosophical to
lose on principle), and now reads something like
this,—“whenever a player is strong in trumps,
and considers from the fall of the cards that it
is expedient they should be drawn, he makes
those facts public,” and as his partner is usually
in possession of the lead at the moment, he is
able to play a trump without unduly straining
himself.</p>

<p>Compulsory peters, anticipated peters, and
peters late in the hand, are matters of common
sense and intelligence, and attempts to lay down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
arbitrary conventions as substitutes for those
qualities are the main causes of the present
decadence of Whist.</p>


<h3>THE ECHO.</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> echo is reported to be an extension of the
signal, and is the most innocuous of the series;
it does very little harm, and always amuses
somebody.</p>

<p>When the signal-man holds half the trumps
and the echoer the remainder, it amuses them
and does not hurt the adversary; for weight
will tell, wholly irrespective of conventions.</p>

<p>When there is a possibility of saving the
game, and it comes into play before the hand
is over, which it seldom does, its usual effect
is to induce the signal-man (seeing his partner
drop a high card) to endeavour unsuccessfully
to force him; then they suffer grief and pain,
and the adversary in his turn is amused.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>




<h2>WOODEN ARRANGEMENT, NO. 2.</h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">This</span> resulted from tampering with the discard.
Though Mathews (<i>circa</i> <small>A.D.</small> 1800) in two short
sentences laid down the true and only principle
of discarding: “If weak in trumps, keep guard
on your adversaries’ suits; if strong, throw away
from them,” fifty years afterwards it was discovered
by the “little school” that “the old
system of discarding was just this—when not
able to follow suit, let your first discard be from
your weakest suit.” Rough on poor Mathews!
but the absent are always wrong.</p>

<p>However, by a process of evolution, to the
first step of which no exception can be taken,
we are next told—(<i>a</i>) “When you see from the
fall of the cards that there is no probability of
bringing in your own or your partner’s long suit
discard originally from your best protected suit.”
“You must play a defensive game.”—<i>Cavendish.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, as the evolution proceeds, and we come
to (<i>b</i>), we catch the first glimpse of the woody
fibre, “for the sake of a short and easily remembered
rule,” it is the fashion to say, “discard
originally from your strong suit when the adversaries
lead trumps, but this aphorism does not
truly express the conditions.” (It does not
indeed; far from it! for the adversaries may
lead trumps and the strength may turn out on
the other side; and why, under any circumstances,
currency should be given to an erroneous
fashion is a question I have repeatedly
asked in vain), and here the pupils rush in,
with that zeal which outruns discretion, overpower
the master and cut the Gordian Knot
with (<i>c</i>) <i>strongest</i>. Fourthly, I am informed
whenever I take my walks abroad in Whist
circles, (<i>d</i>) that with trumps declared against
me I must not only discard from my strongest
suit, but by that discard point out to my
partner—and I presume my adversaries—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
suit I wish led, and we are all on our backs
on the wood pavement.</p>

<p>Is this a defensive game? Surely it is pedantry
run mad! Why am I, in these frightful circumstances,
fighting for dear life, and breathing with
the greatest difficulty, to disclose my vital parts
to a powerful and remorseless enemy? Where
am I to get a suit from that I wish led? Why
am I to be debarred from using my common
sense—if I have any—and holding on to everything
in obedience to my old friend Mathews
and Cavendish on Whist, for both of whom I
have the highest respect? If by good luck I do
hold a very strong suit, I used to be able to point
out that fact by discarding the head of it; now
I am told “you must not do that; it is not <i>the
game</i>”—whatever the game may be; “it shows
the adversary too much;” so that I am in
this absurd dilemma—if I have a really strong
suit, I am to keep it dark; if I have a suit in
which I hope to make a trick by remaining very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
quiet, I am to invite my partner to put me
under the harrow by making me third player. <i>O
tempora! O mores!</i></p>

<p>Bad in itself, and ensnaring to others, this
outrageous latter-day discard is cowardly to a
degree; for while it does no particular injury to
the player with a strong hand, it knocks down
and jumps upon the weak vessel.</p>

<p>What am I to do with a suit in which I hold absolutely
nothing, say the two, three, four and five?
Did the doctrinaires never hear of such a suit?
One would imagine not. Am I to discard from
king, queen and another, or from knave to
four, in order to keep four cards like that?
How about retaining every card of a powerful
suit, regardless where the trumps may be, knowing
that unless it can be brought in somehow or
other, the game is gone? When I am compelled
to discard from a weak five suit, is that an order
to my partner to lead in a singly or doubly
guarded king?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>If these difficulties—and there are numbers
of others—only occurred to me, with my natural
modesty, I should consider myself the victim of
some congenital defect; but this is not the case;
far from it. The confusion on this head alone is
awful, and what do the authorities teach us? I
have already quoted Mathews and Cavendish
on Whist; the second edition of Clay does not
mention the forced discard, but it is mentioned
in the last new and <i>improved</i> edition with a
vengeance: here I learn to my horror and
amazement that “the discard from the <i>strongest</i>
suit * * * <i>is admirably explained and developed
in the ‘Laws and Principles of Whist,’ by
Cavendish</i>.”</p>

<p>Now this statement, which was made in 1881,
is puzzling. I have already pointed out that the
“laws and principles of Whist” by Cavendish
neither explain nor develope anything of the
kind, admirably or otherwise, before and after
that date, Cavendish in <i>The Field</i> has contradicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
it in toto. His latest utterance, on which
I can lay my hand, is this. “The aphorism—discard
from your strong suit to an adverse
trump lead is very imperfect”—as any aphorism,
attempting to lay down a fixed law for such an
intricate subject, is bound to be—“and misleading,
and often gives rise to misunderstandings
between partners as to the true character of the
discard. A player should carefully consider the
aspect of the game at the time the discard is
made. With no indication to guide him, he
may assume his partner’s first discard to be a
protective one, if the adversaries have led, or
called for trumps; but if, notwithstanding an
adverse lead, he can place the command of
trumps with his partner, or must so place it in
order to save the game, he should assume the
reverse.” Here, though somewhat verbose and
obscure, he recognizes that the subject bristles
all over with difficulty.</p>

<p>Now let us return for a moment to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<i>improved</i> Clay. “The discard from the strongest
rests upon, * * * and upon the very reasonable
argument, that the partner is directed to lead
the suit indicated by the discard.” That a protective
discard is a direction to my partner to
make me third player in the suit may seem
reasonable to the modern doctrinaire, but it is
not the view ordinarily taken of it; then having
produced his highly objectionable animal in
<i>puris naturalibus</i>, the Editor winds up by <i>thanking
Cavendish for his imprimatur</i>.</p>

<p>This way madness lies! What Cavendish?
how many Cavendishes are there? there is certainly
a Cavendish on Whist, and there is a
Cavendish in <i>The Field</i>; that makes two, on
this point pretty much of one mind. Is there a
third, who appears for one brief moment, without
father, mother, or descent, mysterious as
Melchizedek, just to contradict both his namesakes,
and then disappears for ever in the ewigkeit?
This conundrum is too much for me; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
give it up, merely enquiring with an ancient
philosopher:—</p>

<h2>THE MODERN GAME.</h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Because</span> a game has been overlaid by petty
detail, and injured by having its square pegs
driven into round holes, it does not on that
account become a modern game, any more than
the Trojan priest, when the serpents set upon
him and strangled him, became a modern Laocoon.
First, this figment of a modern game is
devised, and then used as a convenient peg to
hang other figments upon.</p>

<p>Whist, as far as I have been able to ascertain
from a tolerably careful study of the leading
authorities, “has slowly broadened down from
precedent to precedent;” there has been no
solution of continuity; and other investigators
hold the same belief. “We suspect that Cavendish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
very often objected to that ancient plagiarist
Mathews for stealing his ideas.” “In the
bulk the two systems agree.”—<i>Westminster
Papers.</i></p>

<p>“There is no essential difference between
modern and old-fashioned Whist, <i>i.e.</i>, between
Hoyle and Cavendish, Mathews and J. C.”—<i>Mogul.</i></p>

<p>So “the modern game” would appear to be
an imaginary line, on one side of which stand
all the authorities from Hoyle to Clay, including
Cavendish on Whist;—recently designated fossils—on
the other, “the great twin brethren,”
Cavendish in <i>The Field</i> and the ‘Theory of
Whist.’</p>

<h2>WOODEN ARRANGEMENT, NO. 3.</h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The original lead of the longest suit</span>:—This,
according to all accounts, is the essence of
modern Whist, and if not too much modern it is
certainly modern enough; for take any fossil you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
please, again including Cavendish on Whist,—you
must keep in mind the doubtful personality
of the three Cavendishes—and you will find no
such lead; that it is generally advisable to lead
from your strongest suit, a dogma old as the
everlasting hills, is quite another matter.</p>

<p>All authority is dead against the strongest,
and <i>a fortiori</i> against the longest suit, <i>always</i>
being led.</p>

<p>In the Westminster Papers for February and
March, 1878, the point was thoroughly ventilated;
it is not my intention to quote the articles
in extenso, I have given you chapter and verse,
and if you are anxious to master the subject,
you can either read it for yourself, or consult
the originals.</p>

<p>The editor shows that Hoyle, Paine, Major A.,
Mathews, Clay, and Cavendish on Whist, all teach
that, though the strong suit should <i>generally</i> be
led, the lead depends upon the hand and the
score. He points out that “Mathews recognizes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the fact, which we all deplore, that we must
in the nature of things, have bad hands or
peculiar hands, such that the ordinary lead must
be departed from;” that Hoyle, giving directions
how to play for an odd trick, says, “Suppose
you are elder hand, and that you have ace, king
and three small trumps, with four small cards of
another suit, three small cards of a third suit,
and one small card of a fourth suit, how are
you to play? You are to lead the single card.”
That Major A.—whom Clay describes as likely to
be very formidable among the best players of the
present day—goes so far as to say, “with a bad
hand, do <i>not</i> lead from three or four small cards.”</p>

<p>So much for the books! His conclusion from
observation is “In watching good players, we
find them averse to leading from their long suit
unless they have sufficient trumps or other cards
of re-entry to enable them to establish that suit.
So also with the score advanced; no one dreams
of trying to bring in the long suit.” According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to the play that we see, with great weakness the
rule is rather to lead strengthening cards. For
our own part we should be inclined to say,
“Lead from your strong suit only when you are
sufficiently strong to bring in that suit with the
aid of reasonable strength on the part of your
partner.” “The supposed orthodox lead is
absurd.” My own opportunities for observation
have been considerable, and I say “ditto to
Mr. Burke.” In the teeth of this, we have
Cavendish in <i>The Field</i>, and Dr. Pole, the great
twin brethren again, affirming not only that the
strongest suit should always be led, and that the
strongest suit is the longest, but that “this system
has stood the test of the experience of a century
and a half.”</p>

<p>I should like an answer to this simple
question; if the longest suit is always to be
led, how is it that every Whist book, without
exception, gives minute directions for leading
short suits?</p>

<p>Another red herring trailed across the scent is
that a four suit is a normal suit, and that being
normal it must always be led. In the first place
it is the strong suit, not the long suit, which is
the normal lead; in the second place, what is
‘normal’ by no means invariably takes place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
otherwise why does ‘abnormal’ still remain in
our dictionaries?</p>

<p>When you hold a bad hand, it is just as
philosophical to acquaint your partner with that
unpleasant circumstance by leading a strengthening
card, as it is to lead a long weak suit and
leave him floundering about in ignorance of
everything but its length, and it has a much
greater weight of authority at the back of it.</p>

<p>Pondering where the Dioscuri got hold of
such extraordinary notions, it flashed across my
memory that in childhood’s happy hour, I had
read in Lemprière, that though they spent half
their time with the immortals, they passed the
remainder “in another place;” hence these tears!</p>

<h2>WOODEN ARRANGEMENT, NO. 4.</h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The Lead of the Penultimate and its
Congeners.</span>—Playing Whist some five and
twenty years ago with Cam for my partner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
he led the trey of a suit in which I held king,
queen and another, I won with the queen,
and on the return of the king, which was
taken by the fourth hand, Cam played the
deuce. From subsequent enquiry I found it
was a lead of his own, to inform the table he
had three remaining, and no honour in his
own suit; I had never seen the device before;
I did not think highly of it when I did
see it, and am of the same opinion still; however,
in 1865 it appeared in “What to Lead,”
and was strenuously objected to, by Mogul
among others; but it is only due to the memory
of my old friend,—in his day an authority
second to none—to state, that though tenacious
of his proposition, I never knew him suggest for
one moment, that it was an extension of any
known, or unknown, principle.</p>

<p>The credit of discovering a brand-new principle,
and that the penultimate lead is a legitimate
extension of that discovery is, as far as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
am aware, entirely due to Cavendish’s unassisted
ingenuity; and here we learn incidentally what,
in his view, a principle is; for, after he had concluded
to his own satisfaction, that from suits
containing a sequence that does not head the
suit, the lowest card of the sequence should be
led—although Clay denied this flatly, and
objected to the lead in toto—he straightway
elevated it into a principle.</p>

<p>How the penultimate lead is an extension of
it, I have no idea; he appears to have evolved
both the principle and the extension from his
own internal consciousness. Anti-Cavendish
puts this with such force and perspicuity in the
Westminster Papers, February, 1873, that the
whole article is well worth reading, and in these
convention ridden days is quite refreshing. I
make an extract or two from his conclusion.
“The reasoning on which Cavendish grounds
this invention is so faulty, that one feels that in
the pursuit of his hobby of ‘extension of principle’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
he loses his head altogether.” “It is a
purely arbitrary signal and might much more
plausibly have been proposed as a means of
giving information without all the rigmarole
about ‘extension of principle,’ &amp;c., &amp;c., but then
if so proposed, players would have refused to
adopt it; now, as disguised by Cavendish under
a cloud of words, too many will be ready to
jump at it to save themselves the trouble of
thinking.” “No greater mistake can be made
than to imagine that it is desirable in every case
to give information to your partner, and players
who are always endeavouring to do this, without
reference to the state of their hands, will surely
in the long run suffer. Whether to give or withhold
information frequently tries the discretion of
the best players, and with weak hands the great
necessity is to keep your adversaries in ignorance,
without deceiving your partner. Now if this
new signal were generally adopted, players
would, as regards the lead in question, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
deprived of all discretion, and be compelled
either to give information to their adversaries,
which might be used against them with fatal
effect, or else deceive their partners, whereas
the present lead, if it gives no information does
not deceive your partner. Another disadvantage
is that in nearly all cases where either adversary
wins the second round, he will know whether or
not he can force his partner in that suit without
risk of being overtrumped, but if the original
leader wins the second round his partner will
rarely get any positive information as to his
strength until the third round.” “These refinements
of artifice are utterly opposed to the
essence of scientific Whist, viz., the necessity of
rational deduction. To substitute signals which
convey information, without troubling the brains,
must tend to spoil the game.”</p>

<p>Objections have repeatedly been taken to
these conventions on moral grounds, but as long
as the Church and Stage Guild and kindred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
associations exist, there seems no reason why
we should be troubled to look after our own
morality.</p>

<p>For my own part, although believing the principle
to be extremely doubtful and the extension
far from clear, I am quite prepared to admit that
when you have a reasonable expectation of
bringing in a five suit, it is desirable that you
should make your partner acquainted with the
exact length of it, but I am equally prepared to
deny its expediency when there is no chance of
bringing it in; if such a suit must be played,
and you may be so unfortunately placed that
it is unavoidable, it would be much better
to keep the length of it buried in your own
bosom.</p>

<p>Oddly enough when another writer, emulous
of extending the master, and seduced by the
analogy that what was sauce for the goose must
be sauce for the gander, suggested that if it was
imperative to lead the lowest but one of five, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
must be equally obligatory to lead the lowest
but two of six; (indeed so clear is this next link
in the chain, that it was the very first thought of
myself and some half-dozen other light-minded
persons, the moment we heard of the principle;
but, by ill luck, the seed fell on barren ground,
for so far were we from realizing the importance
of our discovery, and taking immediate steps to
protect the patent, that, sad to relate, <i>solvuntur
tabulæ risu</i>), we find Cavendish in <i>The Field</i> for
a time deprecating such an eminently logical
extension, till I wake up one Saturday morning
and read that the antepenultimate does not go
far enough, and that under pain of becoming
fossils, we must all lead the lowest but three of
seven, but four of eight, and so on until we
arrive at the lowest but nine of thirteen, when
further extension in that direction becomes impracticable.</p>

<p>Fortunately this arrangement has been simplified,
for the game would have become even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
slower than it is, if whenever a player had a
ten suit, he had to repeat to himself, lowest but
one of five, two of six, three of seven, till he
eventually arrived at lowest but six of ten, and
after much laborious whittling at the small end
of nothing, the ultimate outcome is, with any
number of a suit from five to thirteen, to lead
the top but three.</p>

<p>Apropos of this same ultimate outcome, in
the Westminster Papers for January, 1875, there
is a remarkable statement: “We have the
opinion, never published, of a personal friend,
that while you ought to lead the lowest card in
four suits, you should lead <i>the third from the top</i>
in five suits;” and this anonymous genius is still
“unwept, unhonoured and unsung.” Such is
fame!</p>

<h2>SOME PILLARS OF THE EDIFICE.</h2>


<h3>PILLAR NO. 1.—THE PHILOSOPHY OF WHIST.</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> case the <i>ipse dixit</i> of Cavendish in <i>The Field</i>,
or “the preface,” should fail to convince, we have
also had the sacred name of Philosophy dragged
in to countenance these proceedings.</p>

<p>Ever since there has been any record of
philosophers, their schools appear to have been
about as numerous as themselves. Plato for his
own share had five different sets of followers.
All the systems contradicted each other, and the
disciples of each master usually held different
views as to his tenets; as this has continued
down to our own day, for the dogmatic philosopher
who recently died in Chelsea spent more
than half a century in contradicting himself,
while two of the most prominent disciples of
Comte are fighting tooth and nail at this very
moment, when we hear of <i>the</i> philosophy of Whist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the enquiry naturally arises, which philosophy?
The Whist philosophy of Cam, propounded day
by day, was, that there is no absolute never or
always. The same idea runs through the entire
treatise of Clay; and if there is one point more
especially distinctive than another in the teaching
of that great master, repeated again and again,
and constantly insisted upon, it is that all the
maxims of Whist are open to innumerable exceptions,
that the coat must be cut according to
the cloth, and that he is the finest Whist-player
who can most readily grasp that fact. (Here I
may remark, in a parenthesis, that though the
late Mr. Clay eventually gave a qualified assent
to the penultimate lead and the forced discard,
it has yet to be shown that he assented to either
the one or the other, in its present uncompromising
and preposterous form, a form which is
utterly repugnant to his every public utterance).</p>

<p>This is considerably opposed to the fearful
and wonderful philosophy of Dr. Pole, the basis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of which appears to be that it is always imperative
to lead your longest suit, which he naively
admits to be a losing game. It is unfortunate
that his lines are drawn in a commercial age, for
if he had only lived in the time of Don Quixote
he might have taken high rank.</p>

<p>To ignore the teaching of a long line of
illustrious dead, to set precedent at defiance, and
deliberately to go out of your way in order to
lose, is an extension of the old stoical principle,
“under all circumstances to keep your temper,”
in the very best latter-day manner; but reasonably
doubtful as to the success of such an appeal
if left to stand upon its own bottom, he invokes
elementary algebra to his aid. Now elementary
algebra is not devoid of good points; by its
means we learn that a man may—either in time
or in eternity—hold 635,013,559,600 different
whist-hands. Moreover, every hand, he will have
an entirely different purpose; sometimes to win
the game; sometimes to save it, and with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
end in view, will lay himself out to make tricks
varying from three to eleven—below and above
that number, since the invention of short
Whist, he has no need to trouble himself—and
the moral most people would draw, would be
that in that portentous number of hands, some
of them would require very different treatment
from others; the philosopher of Whist, however,
thinks not, but would fit all those six hundred
and thirty-five thousand odd millions of hands
into the same Procrustes’ bed, and would always
lead the longest suit. Again, Whist is an art; if
in any sense a science, it is certainly not an
exact science, and the application of algebra to
art is somewhat limited. There are far too many
unknown quantities in the equation.</p>

<p>Take our old friend king and another in the
second hand; Permutations and Combinations
will inform us sooner or later—I should imagine
later, for to my certain knowledge, a series of four
thousand two hundred and nineteen is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
enough—as to the number of times we shall
make it or lose it, whether we play it, or do
not play it; but they will give us no clue as to
the extent of damage we may receive when it is
played and taken by the third hand, or as to the
loss we incur when the ace is in the fourth hand,
by importing uncertainty into the game. When
we do not put it on and lose it, we may—or may
not—lose one trick; when we put it on and lose
it, we may lose any number. The whole system
of the newly suggested play of the first and
second hand is undermined by the fundamentally
false assumption that the lead is always
from a long suit; that everybody, irrespective
of the score, has merely to ascertain which is
his longest suit, and then to take immediate
steps to put the table in possession of its exact
length is so transparently simple, that such
extreme simplicity in a game of skill is enough
of itself to arouse the gravest suspicion.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Qui studet optatam cursu contingere metam,</div>
<div class="verse">Multa tulit fecitque puer, sudavit et alsit.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Just to see how the plan worked, six consecutive
times have I with king and two others—using
my best judgment as to the lead—passed
the queen led, and six times have I lost a trick;
this may show that my judgment was bad; but
it shows, with much more absolute certainty,
that the lead, in those six cases, was not from
numerical strength.</p>

<p>If the lead always were, it needs no demonstration
to prove that the holder of the king
has seldom anything to gain by heading the
trick; that might be granted without the slightest
demur; only how about the combination game?
If the fourth player has to play the ace on the
queen led, where is the king? certainly, not
according to our present knowledge, in the
second hand with one or two of the suit.</p>

<p>As to not heading the queen with king and
another, one of the latest Cavendish coups, it is
really so puerile, he must be practising upon our
credulity; the veriest bumble-puppist that ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
crawled upon this earth is too well aware that,
every now and again, a trick may be made by
the most absurd and outrageous play—or rather
want of play—otherwise the breed would have
been as extinct as the dodo.</p>

<p>There are positions enough, where the king is
the only card of re-entry and where, unless the
fourth hand can get in with the ace and draw
the trumps, the game is over, but it is not so
here; the coup succeeds, simply and solely,
because, by a most improbable chance, the
fourth hand holds one, while the second player
holds two of the suit. Genuine, unadulterated
bumble-puppy! Whenever I am induced to
propound a system of Whist philosophy, enlivened
with texts from the Gospel according to
Cocker (<i>absit omen</i>), its fundamental principle
will be that four in thirteen goes twice.</p>

<p>If I with king and another head the queen
and make it, and have nothing else to do, I can
return the suit, ruff the third round and make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
three consecutive tricks; not a bad thing in
these hard times when the rental of our estates
is constantly diminishing, and the income tax
has gone up another penny.</p>

<p>Now suppose I pass it and my partner makes
the ace, he must open a new suit. We have had
a surfeit of statistics lately, still, if the gentleman
at present in possession of the calculating
machine of the late Mr. Babbage would kindly
turn the handle, and let me know how many
tricks on the average are lost by merely opening
a suit, I should be much obliged to him. When
the leader and his partner either hold the whole
of it, or nothing at all, it may be done with impunity,
but under ordinary circumstances it
usually entails a loss of one trick and often two.</p>

<p>I have considered at some length the original
lead of the longest suit, and the lead of the
penultimate, because on these two commandments
hang all the latter-day law, but not the
profits: for on the strength—for want of a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
appropriate word—of these figments, at this very
moment our guide is attacking the recognised
play of the third hand, our philosopher is suggesting
an entirely new set of proceedings for
the second hand, while both guide and philosopher
are doing their level best to assist our friend
in New York to bouleverse the leads.</p>


<h3>PILLAR NO. 2.—ILLUSTRATIVE WHIST-HANDS.</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">If</span> you watch a thousand ordinary whist-hands,
the great bulk will be illustrative of (1) human
stupidity; a few (2) of super-human cunning,
and out of the remainder the faddist may pick out
(3) one or two to countenance any form of
mania from which he may be suffering at the
moment.</p>

<p>The first class—always provided that you
meet it in the spirit and not in the flesh—is
often amusing.</p>

<p>The second is, if skilful, generally open to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
objection that, as the same result might be
attained by a more simple and equally legitimate
method of play, there is an enormous
amount of good skill gone wrong.</p>

<p>The third class—and this is the class we have
now to deal with—is never amusing, seldom
skilful, and not uncommonly misses its tip
altogether; for instance, two hands given in the
‘Theory of Whist,’ to illustrate certain leading
principles of the game, were promptly gibbeted
by another eminent authority, and are still hanging
in chains in the Westminster Papers, for
September and October, 1873, as “most striking
examples of brute force and stupidity.”</p>

<p>In any case they prove nothing. Suppose
some malefactor, with a turn for leading singletons,
were to bring before the public a dozen or
two of hands illustrative of results which would
make any leader of the top card but three livid
with envy, at the same time suppressing two,
four, or six dozen hands, where the lead had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
brought him to condign grief, would that in any
way tend to show the lead was good?</p>

<p>Still carefully selected hands, although we may
disapprove of their <i>raison d’être</i>, are not necessarily
revolting to the intelligence; but there is
a limit, and attempting to show such a moral as
this, that with king and another, it is dangerous
to play the king second hand on the queen led,
because your partner may hold the ace single, is
perilously near it.</p>

<p>I am not perhaps so conversant with the
Whist-hands in <i>The Field</i> as I ought to be, for
the difficulty of its Catherine-wheel notation
deters me; but about two years ago, I came
across a few <i>disjecta membra</i> intended to bolster
up some mechanical substitute for brains, and a
similar fragment with a similar intention has
lately been quoted in that paper. To make the
matter more simple we will transpose it from the
first to the third person. “A holds ace, knave,
five, four, three and two of hearts; his partner B<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
holds king, queen and a small heart; A leads the
ace of hearts. He then leads three of hearts.
His left hand adversary, Y, plays ten, B queen,
and Z, fourth player, nine. Neither adversary
has asked for trumps,” which is entirely a matter
of opinion; for as no human being knows, or
ever will know, where a single trump is, Z
might have begun a call, and finding the whole
heart suit dead against him, and knowing the
exact position of every card in it, thought fit to
conceal it. “Consequently two of hearts must
be in A’s hand, and three other hearts besides.”
Up to this point, except the little difference of
opinion as to a signal, our unanimity is wonderful.
“All the trumps now come out,” and B, in
the confusion, gets rid of his king of hearts.
That brief sentence about the trumps, like the
pie in Pickwick, which was all fat, is rather too
rich. If Y and Z had them and they “came
out” against their will, it was rough on Y and Z.
If Y and Z, with the fact staring them in the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that B holds the king of hearts and A the remaining
four—for we are all agreed that this is
clear—took any active steps to induce trumps to
“come out,” they must have been rampant
lunatics; even if Y and Z were not lunatics, but
as ardent admirers of the antepenultimate lead,
and anxious for its success, at any cost to themselves,
merely did their best to ensure the
“coming out” of the trumps, how B got the
opportunity to discard the king of hearts would
still be involved in Stygian darkness. The most
reasonable supposition, if Y and Z really did
lead trumps, is that he dropped it quietly under
the table, in sure and certain hope that they
were the very last people to take a mean advantage
of him. If A and B, in addition to the
entire suit of hearts, had also the strength in
trumps, nothing could prevent those hearts from
being brought in.</p>

<p>Though futile for the purpose designed, the
fragment has two other morals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>(1) That if A and B hold the command of
trumps, and an entire plain suit, they can bring
it in, <i>in spite</i> of proclaiming its exact position
to the adversary.</p>

<p>(2) That if Y and Z hold the trumps, when
an antepenultimate is led, those trumps not
only appear to “come out” of themselves like
mushrooms—spontaneously and without obvious
cause—which in itself would be sufficiently
aggravating, but they “come out” at the most
inopportune moments, to the dire discomfiture
of their unfortunate owners. (If any decently
responsible person will guarantee that my
adversaries will always do their best to get
trumps out for me whenever I lead an antepenultimate,
nobody shall in future have to
complain of my not going far enough in that
direction).</p>

<p>Special arrangements for taking a quantity
above five are seldom of practical use; on
the contrary, such suits have an innate propensity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
for making themselves unpleasantly conspicuous,
without any <i>mécanique</i>.</p>

<p>It must either be a very weak cause to require
such advocacy, or an uncommonly strong one
to survive it.</p>

<h3>PILLAR NO. 3.—DEVELOPMENTS, EXTENSIONS OF
PRINCIPLE, AND GENERALIZATIONS.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The earth hath bubbles as the water hath,</div>
<div class="verse">And these are of them.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A development</span> is such an ambiguous expression
(for it may be either good, bad or indifferent)
that, on that understanding, we may freely admit
its existence; but an extension of principle has
several varieties, is as slippery as an eel, and
both the extension and the principle must be
regarded with a wary eye.</p>

<p>The principle that is extended by substituting
‘always’ for ‘generally’ and then appealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
boldly to history to sanction the alteration is one
form. Another form is to invent both the
principle and the extension when the occasion
arises, as in the principle of leading the bottom
of an intermediate sequence, and its extension
to penultimates, antepenultimates, and so forth.
Logicians term this <i>petitio</i>, not <i>extensio principii</i>.</p>

<p>Even when you have got firm hold of a good
principle, or a good india-rubber ring, you will
get into trouble if you stretch it indefinitely.</p>

<p>There is no sounder principle going than that
it is generally desirable to acquaint your partner
with the state of your hand, but it neither follows
that you should place it face upwards on the
table, nor avail yourself of those extensions
known to Hoyle as “piping at whisk,” though
the first is undoubtedly legitimate, and the
second, if it were only first duly exploited by
some faddist in <i>The Field</i>, would be quite as
legitimate as any extension that has appeared
there in our time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>While these extensions of principle are in the
air, some regard should be paid to the interests
of that numerous class whose information is
entirely derived from inspection of the last trick.
Already they had to find out in that obscure
medium what suit was led, who led it, and how
each card fell. Now, they have in addition, to
track to their lair several missing minor cards,
and when they have succeeded in doing so, to
decide whether they indicate a signal, a nine
suit, the lowest of a long head sequence, or the
lunacy of the leader. If their happiness is to
be taken into consideration one important extension
of principle must be added to the list.</p>

<p>It is a principle—vide law 91—that we may
all see the penultimate trick, and the extension
that we may all see the antepenultimate and so
on up to thirteen, proceeds <i>pari passu</i> with the
other famous demonstration; it also conveys the
same kind of information, in exactly the same
way, for it shows those who have eyes in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
heads that which they already knew, and
reduces to a more hopeless state of imbecility
those dependent on its aid.</p>

<p>I do not advocate it for two reasons; in the
first place, because I abjure and detest the
principle itself; secondly, because the only
time I ever attempted to extend a principle, I
was accused of <i>sorites</i>, which sounds like some
unpleasant form of skin disease, and such
insinuations, though untrue, are disagreeable.
As I do not wish to expose myself to them, I
make a present of the idea to any pupil of the
new academy who may be intent on further
spoiling the game.</p>

<p>“One man’s meat is another man’s poison,”
and what the late Government considered to be
extensions of principle, developments and generalizations,
their successors stigmatize as—</p>

<p class="center">
“Red ruin and the breaking up of laws.”<br />
</p>

<p>The present condition of Whist may be briefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and graphically expressed by the well-known
epitaph:—</p>

<p class="center">
“I was well, I wanted to be better, now I am here.”<br />
</p>

<p>Among all the quasi-extensions of spurious
principles, one fine old crusted principle is in
danger of being lost sight of altogether, and now
that attention is called to it, I sincerely hope
that no modern pedant will be tempted to
extend it. The principle is, <small>TO LEAVE WELL
ALONE</small>.</p>

<p>Such are the three remarkably unstable pillars,
on which rest the proposals for upsetting the
recognized play of the first, second, and third
hand; and if they give way, down comes the
entire superstructure. Happily, the purely
academic discussion on the American leads is
not likely to trouble the general public much;
its fascinations for them are not great, but if
those fascinations should induce the doctrinaire
mind to lessen its mischievous activity in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
directions, it may yet turn out to be a blessing
in disguise. As we are threatened with a book
devoted to these leads, I confine myself to
mentioning that in answer to eighteen enquiries,
“What do you think of the new leads?” sixteen
replies were to the effect that a good player, if
he took his coat off and went into the matter
thoroughly, might master them in six months,
and a duffer, under the same circumstances, in
half a century, but that in neither case was the
game worth the candle; the advice of the other
two, to “go to Bath and get my head shaved,” was
rude, and the latter half of it quite uncalled for.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>WHITTLING AT THE SMALL END OF NOTHING.
CONVENTIONS AND ELABORATE RULES FOR
EXCEPTIONAL PLAY.</h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">So</span> many articles have we had endeavouring
to explain what a convention is, from the
Cavendish point of view, that at last the common-sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
view, driven from these inhospitable
shores by the interminable flux of words, has
taken refuge at the Antipodes; it was seen in
the office of <i>The Australasian</i> in May, 1884,
and I presume it is there yet. If at any time
you happen to be passing through Melbourne,
and send in your card to the editor, I have no
doubt he will show it to you. Item,—two long
articles giving minute directions when not to lead
trumps from five.</p>

<p>If the basis of play is always to lead the longest
suit these directions must be altogether unnecessary;
the answer is self-evident. “You
should invariably lead the penultimate from a
five suit of trumps, save and except when you
hold a plain suit of greater length, and then you
should lead the highest but three.”</p>

<p>Oh that mine enemy always would! for, I
regret to say, some short time ago, a miscreant—one
of the soundest Whist-players in this
country—took up the four, five and six of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
diamonds (trumps); ace, knave, ten, eight, four
and three of hearts; king, six and four of spades;
and the eight of clubs, <i>which he led</i>. His score
was one, ours four. I was second player, and
held, <i>inter alia</i>, ace, queen, seven and six of
clubs; and king, ten, eight, seven and five of
trumps; my partner held king, knave, five and
four of clubs, and though he turned up the
queen of trumps, we lost four by cards and the
game.</p>

<p>Now this is a man who reads his newspaper,
and should, in common decency, have led the ace
and four of hearts. Somewhat nettled by the
success of his nefarious play, I said to him,
“even if you have not seen the Fruits of Philosophy,
you must know better than to lead a
singleton,” and this was his ribald reply:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">How sad and mad and bad it was,</div>
<div class="verse">But still how it was sweet.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To return to my subject. If any one were to
ask me when not to lead trumps with five, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
should reply, “My very dear sir, it is not in my
power to provide you with intelligence, the stock
in my possession is barely sufficient for my own
use; with five trumps, you should lead them
nearly always, especially when you are very weak
in the plain suits; but if, after acquiring a fair
knowledge of general principles, you are unable
to find out for yourself when it is inexpedient to
lead them, I am quite sure nobody can teach
you, and you may depend upon this, that a
multitude of minute rules, purporting to explain
to you when you should not do that which you
would be right in doing ninety-fives times in a
hundred, are a mockery, a delusion, and a snare.</p>

<p>“Lay to heart the story of that little fish, which
desired to know all the mysteries of fishing-tackle,
and when its prayer was granted, was
unable to assimilate its knowledge, and perished
miserably from inanition. At the same time, if,
after what I have said, you should feel disposed
to commit those two articles to memory, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
repeat them to yourself whenever a difficulty
arises, there is nothing in the laws of Whist to
prevent you.”</p>

<p>It is sad to reflect that such an incomparable
talent for applying a straight-waistcoat to every
thing should have blundered into a wrong
groove; a tithe of the energy and perseverance
devoted to throttling intelligence, and knocking
the brains out of the game, would have placed
our villainous code of laws, and our incongruous
and contradictory decisions on a sound basis;
but it was not to be; <i>dis aliter visum</i>, and the
following pathetic appeal, reprinted from
“<i>Knowledge</i>,” has been treated with silent contempt:—</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<h3>A WHIST-PLAYER’S WAIL.</h3>

<p>Whist-players have long been suffering acutely from
three uncertainties—uncertainty of the laws, uncertainty
of decisions, and uncertainty of authority.</p>

<p>The laws are ninety-one in number, and, in “Cavendish
on Whist,” are supplemented by forty-three explanatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
notes and a couple of suppositions, which again
have been further explained—if explain is the right word
in this connection—by innumerable irresponsible decisions.
Now, though it may be Utopian to expect such a
badly-worded jumble of laws and definitions ever to be
superseded by an intelligible code, is it impossible to
have these decisions based on a principle of some kind,
or, at any rate, for them to be consistent with themselves?</p>

<p>At one time the decider has confined himself to the
strictest letter of the law, at another time he has strained
it to breaking; sometimes he has read the laws one with
another; sometimes he has taken one and left the other
out in the cold; sometimes he appears arbitrarily to give
his decision out of his own head, quite irrespective of any
law whatever; and finally, and worst of all, after consistently
maintaining one position for years and years, until—rightly
or wrongly—some doubtful point is settled, he
suddenly turns round, with his tail where his head always
used to be, flatly contradicts himself, and throws it once
more into confusion.</p>

<p>The usual excuse for a <i>volte face</i> of this kind is, “that
this is a free country, where every man has a right to
change his opinions;” and I never hear that dreadful
exordium without instinctively making for the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
knowing from bitter experience that mischief is brewing.
“That judges themselves differ, and the judgment of
one court is often over-ruled by another,” this also is, I
am afraid, true, though it has no bearing on the matter
in hand; for here we have a judge who, on his appointment
to the bench—granting, what is strongly disputed,
that a Whist arbitrator is a judge and has a bench—having
found a well-established precedent and taken it
for his guide in numerous judgments, one fine day reverses
it without notice and without leave to appeal.</p>

<p>To show that I am not making random accusations, I
give three examples—there are others in stock, but these
appear sufficient for my immediate purpose:—</p>

<p>I. “The cards are cut. In taking up the packs, I join
the two packs, but leave one card on the table; this card
would have been the middle, not the bottom card. I
claim a fresh cut; my adversaries claim that it is a misdeal.
Am I entitled to a new cut or not?” Answer,
No. 1. “We think you cannot make your adversary cut
a second time. We do not think that when you left a
card on the table it could be said that there was any confusion
in the cutting, and unless you can make out that
what you did amounted to confusion in the cutting, it is a
misdeal.”</p>

<p>Answer, No. 2. “The claim is void. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
nothing in the laws or the custom of the table to make
this a misdeal.” Both these decisions are by the same
authority. A more recent authority says, “According to
the old rules, a misdeal might have been claimed; but
not now, under Law 34.” The explanation is ingenious,
if not ingenuous; but it is open to the objection that, as
the first decision is dated December, 1873, nine years
after the present laws came into force, it is scarcely
water-tight.</p>

<p>II. If A asked B whether he had any of a suit in
which B had renounced, and B, instead of replying,
turned and quitted the trick, and was subsequently
brought to bed of one or more, his silence, combined
with turning and quitting the trick, was ruled to be an
answer in the negative within the meaning of the Law
and he had revoked.</p>

<p>This is a decision of Clay’s; and though disputed at
the time, was the settled practice of Whist for fourteen
or fifteen years.</p>

<p>Three or four years ago this decision was reversed, and
authority has now taken its stand upon the literal interpretation
of Law 74.</p>

<p>III. Some little time since my opinion was asked on
this point. It was sent to me by a friend in Australia.
“A and B <i>v.</i> Y and Z. Eleven tricks have been played.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
At the twelfth trick A leads a Heart, Y plays a Club, B
plays a Spade. Before Z has played, Y throws down his
last card, which turns out to be a Heart. Has he
revoked?”</p>

<p>Being mortally afraid of putting my foot in it, I much
prefer to leave the mysterious borderland between sanity
and insanity to experts in lunacy; however, in the sacred
cause of friendship, I screwed up my courage, and, with
considerable trepidation, gave an opinion to this
effect. “It appears to me that Y certainly—this sounds
unpleasantly like slang, but such is not my intention—revoked
if the club was a trump, and, probably, if
it was a card of a plain suit, for in playing his last
card he either led or abandoned his hand, which has
always been held to be an act of play establishing the
revoke.”</p>

<p>The question was next submitted to three of the best-known
and most-respected authorities in this country—all
champion deciders—whom we will call P. Q. R. P.
replied, “Unless clubs are trumps I do not think Y. has
revoked. He has not played again. He has exposed a
card. If clubs were trumps I think he has played again
(am not sure). The case is not sufficiently stated for a
positive opinion.”</p>

<p>Q. and R. did not regard it as insufficiently stated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
any way, and they had no hesitation in saying that Y had
not revoked.</p>

<p>When by the next mail it turned out that hearts were
trumps, when, consequently, the revoke was a shade
more doubtful than before, while P made no further sign,
Q and R came to the unanimous conclusion that Y had
revoked. The authority at the Antipodes who ruled
originally that there was no revoke, remains in the same
mind up to the present time.</p>

<p>Is this “vacillating and inconsistent,” or is it not?</p>

<p>Here in a not very complicated difficulty—if only there
was any agreement on first principles, we have</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A benighted outsider thinking a revoke is established,
because a well-known decision overrides the law;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) An intelligent colonist thinking it is not established,
because he considers the law to override the decision.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Authority No. 1 giving a somewhat uncertain sound,
but on the whole inclining to the belief that it is either a
revoke or it is not; evidently a man of judicial mind.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Authorities 2 and 3, while never in doubt for a
moment, first affirming a thing to be white, and afterwards,
when it has been bleached and is to some extent
whiter than before, with unabated confidence affirming it
to be black; and there an important question, involving
the highest penalty known to the law, rests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>If the force of absurdity can go beyond this, then “it
can go anywhere and do anything.”</p>

<p>The facts are in a nutshell. Either <i>Y</i>, when he threw
his card up, abandoned his hand, or he did not. If he
did, and <i>if that is an act of play which establishes a revoke</i>,
then he revoked; if he did not, he had merely to say so,
<i>cadit quæstio</i>; the card is an exposed one—“just that,
and nothing more.” Only we have one, or rather two
little difficulties to get over. Does abandoning the hand
establish a revoke? and, if it does, is the decision
authoritative—that is to say, of compulsory obligation?</p>

<p>Who the original decider was, or who gave him
authority to make a penal enactment in the teeth of Laws
58 and 73, I do not know. All I do know is that the
decision must not be fathered on Clay, for his case 8,
“<i>A</i> has revoked; <i>his claim of the game</i> and throwing
down his cards must be held as against himself as an act
of playing,” is not on all fours; it occupies much firmer
ground.</p>

<p>Here are two well-matched decisions, “Silence is an
answer.” “Throwing down the cards establishes a
revoke,”—of course, with the proviso that one has been
made—both strain the law; both entail the revoke
penalty; the only difference is that one is in the <i>ipsissima
verba</i> of Clay, the other is a mangled excerpt; if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
strong one has been quietly and surreptitiously burked,
why, in the name of ordinary patience, does the weaker
survive?</p>

<p>If decisions are retreating all along the line to a safer
standpoint on the letter of the law, well and good; only
tar them all with the same brush, and take some means
to let the public know it.</p>

<p>Before the lamented demise of the Westminster Papers,
disputed points were argued at length; whether in the
number of counsellors there was wisdom, or whether too
many cooks spoiled the broth, in either event we heard
both sides. Question and answer could be found together,
and if the decision did not invariably commend itself to
our intelligence, we at any rate knew what the decision
was, and that was the main point; but now our position
has changed greatly for the worse. The present practice
of Whist—a direct incentive to gambling—is this; whenever
any doubt arises, instead of being able to lay their
hands upon the recorded decision and settle it at once, the
parties concerned first make a bet of one or more
sovereigns and then write to the <i>Field</i>. On the ensuing
Saturday afternoon a certain amount of money changes
hands; two people are wiser, but the increase of wisdom
is confined to themselves, and at the very next table the
same process is repeated; while numerous quiet, well-meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
people like myself, who never bet, never know
anything at all; for such answers as these, “X. It is a
revoke,” “A. S. S. You cannot call on Z to pass it,”
partake very much of the nature of Valentines in that,
however interesting they may be to the recipient, they
arouse no corresponding emotion in the world at large.</p>

<p>Lastly, with regard to the authority.</p>

<p>Whist-players are law-abiding to a degree, and sufferance
is the badge of all their tribe; but still they would
like to know how the authority obtained what the imperfect
Member for Northampton is so fond of calling his
mandate; whether by divine or hereditary right, by competitive
examination, by election, by appointment from
the Crown, or whether he sits upon us by “the good old
rule, the simple plan” <i>of force majeure</i> as the Old Man
of the Sea sat upon Sindbad.</p>

<p>Bartholomew Binns, an official with the highest credentials,
after being selected from numerous candidates, and
receiving a mandate from the sheriffs of London and
Middlesex, has his decisions reviewed by twelve good men
and true, and reporters are present who publish them
through the length and breadth of the land? How is
our executioner appointed? Who reviews his decisions?
How are they promulgated? Not that it matters to me,
personally. When my fatal Monday comes round and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
<i>sus. per coll.</i> is written under my name in the family
archives, I do not imagine it will trouble me much
whether the operator was born great, has achieved greatness,
or has had greatness thrust upon him. I do not
object to the instrument, I object to the system; but
many Whist-players are more fastidious, and protest
strenuously against being treated worse than other
criminals. They hold that the position of a functionary
who takes upon himself to decide important questions of
law, and to upset old-established precedents, and manufacture
new ones on his mere <i>ipse dixit</i>, should be very
clearly defined, and that if one man is to unite in his own
proper person the attributes of prophet, priest and king—three
single gentlemen rolled into one—he should be duly
anointed, consecrated and crowned, <i>ad hoc</i>.</p>

<p>For questions involving common courtesy, for insoluble
verbal quibbles, for ethical questions of this type, “Ought
A to sit quietly at the table while his partner B picks Z’s
pocket? and if he ought, is it right for him to share the
plunder?” and for the host of minor cases which constantly
arise, and for which no law could possibly provide,
no better arrangement than the present could be devised.
As long as maniacs exist in the land, klepto-, dipso-, homicidal,
or Whist—offences must come, and in disposing of
them—where a cadi is the only effective treatment that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
can be openly suggested—the editor of the <i>Field</i> is <i>facile
princeps</i>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">In faith he is a worthy gentleman,</div>
<div class="verse">Exceedingly well read.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Only if he is to be the <i>de facto</i> authority in <i>all</i> cases, why
not give him the three sanctions just mentioned, and make
him the authority <i>de jure</i>? Then—as the <i>Field</i> is not a
Whist gazette, and can scarcely be expected to devote its
columns to advertising gratuitously every legislative
change, and any space it has to spare is used rather for
elaborating the ceremonial than for settling the laws of
the cult—in token of our esteem, let us club together and
present him with a piece of chalk, a duster, and a black
board, to be set up in some easily-accessible spot—say,
the middle of Pall Mall, or St. James’s-street. Make it
the official notice-board! When new decisions are
created let them be legibly inscribed upon it, <i>coram
populo</i>! When well-known decisions are abrogated let
them be carefully rubbed out at once. Since the Bastille
was destroyed and <i>lettres de cachet</i> with it, there has been
no authority without a notice-board; the Salvation Army
has its “War Cry,” and the Pope himself, when he propounds
a new dogma, propounds it <i>ex cathedrâ</i>.</p>

<p>That is one remedy. Though it is not perfect it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
two advantages—it is inexpensive, and if in future any of
us should still remain in ignorance, we should be in
ignorance by our own fault, and not by misfortune; and
at any rate it is a more simple and less tortuous plan than
upsetting well-known decisions in an unofficial newspaper,
while new editions of our two standard Whist-books
are subsequently brought out without one word of
comment or warning.</p>

<p>The alternative remedy—by no means novel, it has been
suggested, <i>usque ad nauseam</i>, and I only bring it forward
again because at present confusion is worse confounded
than it has ever been in my recollection—is for the leading
clubs to appoint a small committee of representative
Whist-players, with power to revise any decisions they
may see fit; and when they have revised them either to
append them to the laws of Whist, or to place each decision
as a rider under its own particular law, and every
such decision should be final.</p>

<p>Questions of strict law should never have been submitted
to an arbitrator at all; they should have been
cleared up long ago by the legislators themselves; though
important, they are not very numerous, and as they have
been well threshed out, and all their difficulties are known,
the entire matter might be completed in a few hours. Why
should London wait?</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The constitution of Whist and the constitution
of our beloved country are both at the mercy of
a grand old man of exuberant verbosity, each of
whom is able, in some extraordinary way, to
persuade himself that the side of any question
on which he happens to be looking, is not only the
right side, but that it positively has no other, in

existence, he has himself, both recognised and
vehemently supported that other side.</p>

<p>Always doubtful of my own arithmetic, I am
indebted for the following figures to a little boy
who has recently passed the Fourth Standard at
an adjacent Board-school. He informs me that
during the last decade three and a quarter
inches of small print have been devoted by the
editor of the <i>Field</i> to explaining that the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
rule of play at Whist is to discard from your best
protected suit, when trumps are declared against
you; twenty-one square inches to supporting the
usual lead of a small card, from ace to four; and
three square inches to reversing Clay’s and his
own long-established decision, that silence is an
answer; seventy-eight square inches to minute
directions when not to lead trumps from five;
three hundred and fifty-eight square inches to
explaining what a convention is, and one acre,
two roods, and eight perches—be the same
more or less—to articles and hands purporting
to illustrate the American leads, and placing
the sheep on the right and the goats on the left,
we have:—</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> twelve years one general principle has been
faintly upheld, while three have been stretched
on the rack and distorted till their own mothers
would scarcely know them.</p>

<p>If poor Mathews were to revisit the glimpses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of the moon, and to come across that <i>improved</i>
edition of Clay, could he ever guess that the
ricketty abortion in the preface had ever been
his own healthy and intelligent bantling?</p>

<p>Whist-players of every degree, from Deschapelles
to Mrs. Juggins, are now all supposed
to lead the same card—I know they try; for,
after much anxious thought, I have often seen
the penultimate led from king, queen and three
small cards—and with such a hand as this: ace,
king, queen, knave of diamonds; two, three,
four, five, six and seven of hearts; two and three
of clubs; and the deuce of spades (trumps),
whatever the score, if Deschapelles were to
lead the king of diamonds, and Mrs. Juggins
the four of hearts, according to our latest teaching,
the old woman would receive the gold
medal for scientific play, while Deschapelles
would not be in it.</p>

<p>More than that, although while Mrs. Juggins
was making futile attempts to establish her long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
suit, and to explain she held originally six,
several diamonds would probably be discarded,
and she would be in danger of never making a
trick at all; the apparent end of conventions,
philosophy and American leads being not to
make tricks, but to enable the table to count
your hand, the award would be right.</p>

1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
